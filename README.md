# ExploringSpace

Here we have a small web application that hooks up to a few outer space themed API's so that the user can interact with their data. Currently, the app is connected to the following APIs:
* [NASA's APOD](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod)
* [Open Notify](http://open-notify.org/)

If you have any suggestions or would like to see something, please drop me a line :D

[Check out my TODO list, if you're curious](TODO.md)

## Running the Web App Locally

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8. Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
